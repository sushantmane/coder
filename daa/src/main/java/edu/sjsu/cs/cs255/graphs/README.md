# Graphs
Types:
* Undirected Graphs
* Directed Graphs (Digraph)

* Unweighted Graphs (u, v)
* Weighted Graphs (u, v, w)

* Special Types:
    * Trees
        * Rooted Trees
    * Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
    * Bipartite Graphs
    * Complete Graphs
    
* Representing Graphs
    * Adjacency Matrix
    * Adjacency List
    * Edge List


## Problems in Graph Theory

## Depth First Search (DFS)
* Time complexity: O(V + E)
* Application: find number of strongly components

## Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Time complexity: O(V + E)
